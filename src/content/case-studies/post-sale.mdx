title: "Hi, I confirmed the sale, now what?"
introduction: |
  After selling a car on Motorway, users entered a black box. What should've been straightforward—verification, scheduling, inspections, payments—was a fragmented, offline process.

  In 2025, I defined the vision for a post-sale journey as a critical business opportunity, securing exec buy-in, establishing a new product vertical, and uniting the team around a shared mission and objectives.

  Impact: Reduced inbound enquiries by 32%, dealer contact by 27%, and achieved 56% organic adoption. More importantly, it established a defensible moat, turning an anxiety-driven process into a clear, scalable product vertical that became central to Motorway's trust and transparency strategy.

I kept seeing the same thing in support tickets and reviews: "I sold my car and then… nothing." So I wanted to figure out if this was a real problem and address the question:  How does the lack of post-sale visibility impact user trust and satisfaction? I partnered with customer Support and data teams to audit support tickets and operational workflows. I discovered:

1. 100% of sales rely on WhatsApp and phone calls, causing delays, cancellations, lack of understanding into conversion cycle, and uncertainty about the next steps
2. 56% of inquiries stem from "unsure of next steps", increasing support costs and lowering user confidence

To deepen understanding, I ran a cross-functional workshop with PMs and designers. We mapped the current journey, annotated pain points, and identified where the experience broke down across teams.

How might we improve Motorway's post-sale experience from a 'black box' into a transparent, self-serve journey that reduces operational friction:

1. Provide real-time visibility into post-sale steps (e.g., scheduling, payments) to eliminate anxiety about "what's next" and to scale operations by digitising manual workflows
2. Replace WhatsApp/phone dependency to reduce delays and cancellations
3. Design a transparent process that positions Motorway as a disruptive innovator by solving an industry-wide pain points

With goals defined, I created a vision storyboard to illustrate what a post-sale experience could look like. It aligned the company around a shared future, showing how transparency could scale.

I presented it to executives as a business-critical differentiator. The Head of Product championed the vision, and together we partnered with product leads to prioritise opportunity areas across squads, balancing short-term impact with scalable bets.

This alignment led to the creation of a dedicated post-sale pillar, where I partnered with a PM and six engineers to ship the MVP.
