<Section title="Overview">

This is an example case study to demonstrate the MDX-based case study system. You can write regular markdown content here, use custom components like `<Section>` and `<CSImage>`, and organize your content in a structured way.

The system is designed to be simple and flexible, allowing you to focus on writing great content without worrying about layout or styling.
